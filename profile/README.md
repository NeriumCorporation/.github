# Nerium 🌿

**Nerium** is a developer-first platform focused on building **practical infrastructure tools** for modern software teams.

Our goal is simple: **help developers control, measure, and monetize their systems without unnecessary complexity**.

Nerium is not about hype or speculative tech. It is about shipping tools that solve real problems.

## 🚀 Current Focus: Pulse

**Pulse** is the first product built under Nerium.

Pulse is an **API control and monetization layer** that allows teams to:

- Create and manage API keys
- Apply rate limits and quotas
- Track API usage in real time
- Enforce plans per customer or project
- Monetize APIs via subscriptions or usage-based billing

Pulse is designed to be:

- **Dev-first** – easy to integrate, minimal setup  
- **Infrastructure-light** – no heavy gateways or vendor lock-in  
- **Product-ready** – built to ship, sell, and scale  

Think of Pulse as the **heartbeat of your APIs**.

## 🧠 Why Nerium?

Most infrastructure projects fail because they are:

1. Over-engineered  
2. Hard to adopt  
3. Built around theory instead of real developer needs  

Nerium follows a different philosophy:

- Small, focused tools  
- Clear value from day one  
- Strong technical fundamentals  
- Built by developers, for developers  

No buzzwords. No unnecessary abstraction.

## 🧩 What We Build

Nerium focuses on:

- API infrastructure  
- Developer tooling  
- Usage analytics and control layers  
- Monetization primitives for software products  

Each product is designed to stand on its own, while fitting into a broader ecosystem over time.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Pulse (MVP):** API keys, rate limiting, usage tracking, billing  
- **Pulse (Growth):** analytics, alerts, webhooks, SDKs  
- **Future:** advanced execution layers and infrastructure primitives  

The roadmap is driven by real developer pain points, not speculation.

---

## 🤝 Who This Is For

- Indie hackers  
- Startups building APIs  
- SaaS teams monetizing usage  
- Developers who want control without running heavy infrastructure  

If you ship APIs, Nerium is for you.

## 🚧 Project Status

Nerium is currently in **active development**.

The focus is on delivering a solid, usable MVP before expanding functionality.
