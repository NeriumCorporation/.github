# Nerium 🌿

**Nerium** is a blockchain-based platform focused on **digital identity, access control, and verifiable trust**, designed for **non-public (permissioned) environments** where organizations, institutions, and users operate with clearly defined roles.

The vision behind Nerium is simple but ambitious: **make identity, permissions, and digital proofs native, verifiable, and secure**, without relying on open public blockchains or single centralized authorities.

---

## 🧠 What is Nerium?

Nerium is **not a public blockchain** and **not a cryptocurrency**.

It is a **permissioned blockchain infrastructure** that acts as a **trust layer** for:

* Digital Identity (IAM)
* Digital Licenses
* Cryptographic Signatures and Proofs
* State and validity verification
* Token-based access control

All of this is built with an **enterprise-ready, modular, and auditable** mindset.

---

## 🔐 Core Use Cases

### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

* Decentralized identities (DIDs)
* Tokenized roles and permissions
* Dynamic, state-based access control
* Verifiable delegation and revocation

### 2. Digital Licenses

* Licenses issued by authorized entities
* Non-transferable (soulbound) tokens
* On-chain renewal, expiration, and revocation
* Instant third-party verification

### 3. Signatures, Proofs & Verification

* Proof of existence (PoE)
* Auditable cryptographic signatures
* Verification without exposing sensitive data
* Integration with external systems

### 4. Token-Based Access Control

* Tokens as access keys
* Time-bound or conditional access
* Usage in APIs, internal platforms, and physical systems

## 🧱 Design Principles

* **Permissioned by design**: only authorized actors
* **Privacy-first**: minimal data exposure
* **Modularity**: each component can evolve independently
* **Auditability**: everything is verifiable
* **Interoperability**: compatible with Web2 and Web3 systems

---

## 🧩 Architecture (High Level)

* **Core Chain**: permissioned ledger
* **IAM Layer**: identities, roles, and policies
* **Token Layer**: licenses and access tokens
* **Verification Layer**: proofs and validations
* **API / SDK**: external integration

*(Detailed architecture will be documented progressively)*

## 🚧 Project Status

Nerium is currently in the **design and prototyping phase**.

Active work includes:

* IAM model definition
* Control token specifications
* Verification flow design
* Repository and module structure

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Goal

To establish Nerium as a **reference infrastructure** for organizations that require:

* Trust without single points of authority
* Fine-grained access control
* Verifiable and sovereign identity
* Compliance and auditability by design
